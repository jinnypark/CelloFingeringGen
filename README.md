# CelloFingeringGen
# This code generates Cello Fingerings using dynamic programming. 
# The algorithm for dynamic programming is adpted from Christopher Raphael's PianoFingering program.

# Test pieces are taken from Suzuki Cello Book I.
# Pitches are represented in integers, where 0 is 'middle c', C4. 
# different registers are represented as follows:
### 0 is C4.
### 12 is C5.
### 24 is C6
# this code does not care about enharmonic spelling
### 1, 13, 25 are C# or Db, each in differen octaves.
